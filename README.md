# velcro

Making working with zippers a little bit less painful.

## Usage

Include this in your project.clj:

```clojure
[velcro "0.0.1"]
```

Velcro should be used for replacing elements within a form:

```clojure
(ns my-ns
  (:require
    [velcro.core :refer :all]))

(replace-in '(1 + 2)
            [current-node]
            (by (fn [_] '-))
            (where #(= (current-node %) '+)))
; => '(1 - 2)

(replace-in '(1 + 2)
            [left-node]
            (by inc)
            (where #(= (current-node %) '+)))
; => '(2 + 2)

(replace-in '(1 + 2)
            [right-node]
            (by dec)
            (where #(= (current-node %) '+)))
; => '(1 + 1)

(replace-in '(test "testing the function" 1 -> 2)
            [left-node current-node right-node]
            (by (fn [actual _ expected] (list '= actual expected)))
            (where #(= (current-node %) '->)))
; => '(test "testing the function" (= 1 2))

(replace-in '((println "begin") (my-let [a 1 b 2] (+ a b)) (println "done"))
            [up-node]
            (by (Æ’ [form] `(let ~(second form) ~(first (drop 2 form)) (println "wrapped"))))
            (where #(= (current-node %) 'my-let)))
; => '((println "begin") (clojure.core/let [a 1 b 2] (+ a b) (clojure.core/println "wrapped")) (println "done"))
```

You can also splice the result of your function:

```clojure
(replace-in '(my-funky-let [a 1 b 2] (+ a b))
            [current-node right-node]
            (by-spliced (fn [_ let-body] (list 'let let-body)))
            (where #(= (current-node %) 'my-funky-let)))
; => '(let [a 1 b 2] (+ a b))
```
